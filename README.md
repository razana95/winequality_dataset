# Wine Quality Prediction-classification model

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical attributes. The dataset used for this project contains information on different attributes of the wine, such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol.

## Dataset

The dataset can be accessed through the following link: Wine Quality Dataset

The dataset consists of the following columns:

Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
The target variable is the wine quality, which is classified as either good or bad, represented by the values 1 and 0, respectively.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify the quality of wine based on the given attributes. The model will be trained using the provided dataset, and its performance will be evaluated based on various evaluation metrics.

## Methodology

The project will follow these general steps:

**Data exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distribution of variables, and identify any patterns or correlations.
**Data preprocessing**: Handle missing values, if any, and preprocess the data by scaling or normalizing the features as necessary. Convert categorical variables, such as wine quality, into numerical representations.
**Feature selection**: Select the most relevant features from the dataset based on their importance and correlation with the target variable.
**Model training**: Train various machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, using the preprocessed dataset. Use appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the performance of each model.
**Model evaluation and selection**: Compare the performance of different models and select the one that provides the best accuracy and predictive power.

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Download the Wine Quality Dataset from the provided link.
Install the necessary libraries and dependencies required for the project.
Load the dataset into your preferred programming environment or notebook.
Perform data exploration and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for model training.
Train and evaluate different machine learning models to predict the wine quality.
Choose the best performing model and deploy it for real-time predictions.

## Conclusion

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical attributes. By building and deploying a machine learning model, we can accurately classify wine quality as good or bad. The insights and predictions derived from this model can be valuable in the wine industry for quality assessment and decision-making.
